Dependencies
============

Flow requires:

    - Vrui 2.3
      (http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/Vrui/Download.html)
      
    - GLE Tubing and Extrusion Library > 3.1
      (http://www.linas.org/gle/)
      
      This is available on Debian-like systems via:
      
        sudo apt-get install libgle-dev
        
    - FTGL 2.1.3 
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftgl
      
      This is available on Debian-like systems via:
      
        sudo apt-get install libftgl-dev
        
Configuration
=============

Open 'Makefile' and change the line which says:

  override VRUI_MAKEDIR = ...
  
Change this so that it points to the subdirectory which contains your
Vrui.makeinclude file.


Build
=====

Type:
  
    make
    

Installation
=============

At this point, you can install flow systemwide with:

  make install

but you may need to adjust some parameters in the Makefile before doing so.
Alternatively, you can choose to run flow within this directory.  To run on
your laptop try:

  ./flow -mergeConfig etc/2D.cfg
  
Then the keys 1,2,3 (not on the keypad) are automatically configured for flow.

  1 - primary click
  2 - alternate click
  3 - tool rotator
  
The mouse behaves like it does for any Vrui program.  In order to begin using
the program, you must right-click with the mouse and select an "Experiment".
Then press 3 to select a tool, and then 1 to use the tool.
