Overview
========

Dynamics Toolset is an application for exploring dynamical systems. It is
built using the Vrui software development toolkit and is capable of running
on everything from desktops to fully immersive CAVE environments.

Requirements
============

3D Visualizer requires Vrui version 1.0 build 050 or newer. Additionally, 
libpng has to be installed, and Vrui has to be configured with support for PNG 
images (see Vrui README file).

Installation Guide
==================

1. Change into the Dynamics Toolset base directory:
   > cd DynamicsToolset

2. Edit the Makefile, setting the VRUIDIR variable to the root Vrui
   directory. NOTE: this is not the directory containing the Vrui
   source files, but rather the directory specified via the INSTALLDIR
   variable in Vrui's makefile.

3. Generate the dynamics source code. The Dynamics Toolset comes with 
   several systems already defined (etc/dynamics.xml). You may add more
   by simply adding the necessary information to the xml file. To 
   generate the source code run the python script:
   > bin/generate_generate_plugin_code.py etc/dynamics.xml

4. Build the Dynamics Toolset and compile plugin code:
   > make

5. [Optional] Generate documentation. If you are planning on modifying
   the source code it may be helpful to have documentation. To generate
   it using Doxygen:
   > make doc

Running the Dynamics Toolset
============================================

To run the program simply type
   > FieldViewer
   
The tool selector can be brought up by pressing '2' on the numeric keypad (make
sure that NumLock is on). Once a tool is selected it can be used by pressing
'0'. All other options and settings can be accessed from the program's main 
menu, which is bought up by clicking the right mouse button.
